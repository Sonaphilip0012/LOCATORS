## PROBLEM WE SOLVED

A decentralized application used for storing patient treatment records. If a patient visits several hospitals over the course of his or her life, he/she doesn't even know about the medicines taken by them. Every time he or she visits a new hospital, the entire checkup process must be repeated. This makes both the patient and the doctor burdened since it takes more time and increases the severity of the disease. Consider a condition: if a person is seriously admitted due to a heart attack, the doctor can soon treat him according to the treatment records. So, using our application, we can save lives and time. A record of treatment details will be visible to the doctor, and he can treat the patient according to the previous medical records. Using our application, the patient and their close relatives have control of our patient records which are stored as NFTs and they can control the overall visibility of treatment records.


## CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO

The biggest problem faced during the learning and coding phase was the initial setup and the bug-hunting process. Staying motivated throughout the hackathon period was another big challenge that we faced. Integrating various protocols within the project which was completely new was a big challenge.  But we tried our best to remain motivated and build this project to our best. We faced a lot of problems to make a login page using Arcana. Login was falling most of the time. So we had to use another means of auth as backup


## HOW TO USE

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
